- Updating a project's name, tag, group, category, template and metadata in realtime from within a stream
- Updating a jobs' metadata in realtime from within a stream
- New {project.locked} wildcard (results in true/false)
- PRESTREAM's to filter IO jobs in advance, like Autoimport or Watchfolders (extensions for eg)
  - New feature called PreStreams.
Whenever you setup an IO Profile, you can optionally choose a PreStream (new Stream Event in IO) that will be executed before the Job is published.
This can be either a client or a server Stream. Itâ€™s an generic stream so it should NOT be used for heavy tasks (since multiple might run simultaneously).
If the Stream fails, a job will NOT be created and an error message will be thrown in the panel. You can use the Job Status Action to set the job to FAILED or SUCCESSFUL (or QUEUED) right away.
You can also use the Job Delete Action which will delete the Job silently, no errors, no Job in the Dashboard etc. Perfect for unwanted extensions / paths during Autoimport or Watchfolders. Keep in mind that it's hard to debug for a user why a job does not show up (only debuggable in stream debugger)
